// TODO
// retriew document from solid pod
// verify signature (based on mode - a/b/c)
// a - is on blockchain & not invalidated by owner
// b - is on blockchain & timestamped by trusted TSA (CA) - based on derivation of master key? (each signing TSA signs with master key derivation)
// c - original owner=signee & transfer ownership with master key derivation (only this document can be signed with this sugnature => hack check => record used signing certificate)
